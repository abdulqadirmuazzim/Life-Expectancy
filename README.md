# Introduction:
Welcome to my data science protfolio project. For this project I will be analyzing the data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank and identifying the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

**Questions to answer**:
+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the distribution of life expectancy?
+ What is the distribution of GDP ?

The data for the GDP and Life expectancy has been provided by the [Wrold Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and [World Health Organization (WHO)](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688) repactively
